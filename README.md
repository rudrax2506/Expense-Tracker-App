# 💰 Expense Tracker App (MERN + TailwindCSS)

I am excited to share that I’ve started working on a fully responsive Expense Tracker App using the **MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)** stack, styled with **Tailwind CSS**. This application helps users seamlessly manage their personal finances by tracking incomes and expenses, visualizing data through interactive charts, and exporting records for analysis.
